			This thing called love I just can't handle it<br>
			This thing called love I must get round to it<br>
			I ain't ready<br>
			Crazy little thing called love<br><br>

			This thing (this thing) called love (called love)<br>
			It cries (like a baby)<br>
			In a cradle all night<br>
			It swings (woo woo)<br>
			It jives (woo woo)<br>
			It shakes all over like a jelly fish<br>
			I kinda like it<br>
			Crazy little thing called love<br><br>
			There goes my baby<br>
			She knows how to Rock'n'Roll<br>
			She drives my crazy<br>
			She gives me hot and cold fever<br>
			Then she leaves me in a cool cool sweat<br><br>
			
			I gotta be cool relax get hip!<br>
			Get on my track's<br>
			Take a back seat<br>
			Hitch hike<br>
			And take a long ride on my motor bike<br>
			Until I'm ready<br>
			Crazy little thing called love<br><br>

			I gotta be cool relax get hip!<br>
			Get on my track's<br>

			Take a back seat<br>
			Hitch hike<br>
			And take a long ride on my motor bike<br>
			Until I'm ready (ready Freddie)<br>
			Crazy little thing called love<br>

			This thing called love I just can't handle it<br>
			This thing called love I must get round to it<br>
			I ain't ready<br>
			Crazy little thing called love... <br>
			
			Aaaaaa....
